VR Builder Pro is an interactive 3D room creation tool where users can instantiate furniture like sofas, tables, and lamps with illumination effects. It supports wall and ground placement, controlled via keyboard inputs ('I' for panel, scroll for furniture types, 'E/Q' to switch within categories). Navigation is done using a first-person controller, which can be replaced with a VR script for full VR integration. The project offers a game-like environment to easily visualize and experience interior setup.
